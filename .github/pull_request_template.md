## What to expect

<!-- The expected behaviour after following the steps above. -->

## Backend

<!-- Leave this section empty: your preview runs against the dev backend.
     Only if this PR needs backend work that isn't on dev yet, add a line here starting with "Backend URL:"
     followed by that backend's host, for example https://api.<team>.groups.zedu.chat. The Backend dependency
     check then blocks merging until the backend lands on dev and you delete the line. -->

## Test evidence

<!-- The Fork build check reports the build result automatically. Say which backend you tested against,
     and whether tests were added or updated for what this ticket changed (and why not, if not). -->

## Mandatory checks

- [ ] **Atomic:** one logical change, at most ~400 lines of meaningful code (lockfiles and generated files like `*.tsbuildinfo` don't count). Larger needs a `size-override` label from a reviewer.
- [ ] **Database / API contract:** schema changes follow Expand-Contract — no destructive drops or renames.
- [ ] **Preview:** I checked the change in my fork's preview (or the fork build, if the team hasn't set up previews).
- [ ] **Protected files:** I did not change `.github/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` or tooling config without reviewer agreement and the `config-change-approved` label.

## Screenshots / recording

<!-- Required for visible or interactive changes. Otherwise write "N/A, non-visual change". -->
